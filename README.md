AI-Powered Fraud Detection Tool
   
🚀 Project Overview
This AI-powered fraud detection SaaS prototype is a portfolio project designed to showcase fintech expertise in machine learning for real-time risk assessment. Leveraging anonymized credit card transaction data, it detects fraudulent activity with 83% recall and 91% AUC, tackling the core fintech challenge of imbalanced datasets (fraud rates ~0.1-0.2%, per Visa benchmarks).
Key demonstrations:

Fintech Application: Rare-event anomaly detection with ethical AI practices (e.g., oversampling to reduce bias in risk flagging, aligning with GDPR/PCI-DSS compliance).
New Technologies Learned: Supervised ML via scikit-learn (ensembles), imbalanced-learn (SMOTE for minority class handling), Streamlit (interactive dashboards), and seaborn/matplotlib (explainable viz)—building scalable pipelines for fintech roles at firms like Stripe or JPMorgan.

The full ML lifecycle is implemented: EDA → Modeling → Deployment. Prototype built in 1-2 weeks using free tools. Live demo: Input mock txn features → Instant fraud probability + explainers.
🛠 Tech Stack

Core Language/Framework: Python 3.12, Jupyter Notebooks (EDA), Streamlit (web UI).
ML & Data: scikit-learn (Random Forest), imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), pandas/numpy (wrangling).
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn (correlations, distributions).
Deployment & Utils: Streamlit Cloud (hosting), joblib (model serialization).
Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud (284,807 txns; features: Time, Amount, V1-V28 PCA-anonymized, binary Class).
Environment: Conda (reproducible isolation).

📊 Key Results & Insights

Dataset: 284,807 txns (~2 days); fraud: 0.17% (492 cases)—extreme imbalance highlighted in EDA.
EDA Wins: Correlations up to |0.15| (V11/V4 as fraud signals); fraud patterns: Low Amount/off-hours—engineered 'Hour' feature.

🏗 Setup Instructions
Clone and run locally in ~5 mins (macOS/Conda assumed; adapt as needed).

Clone Repo:
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud_detector.git
cd fraud_detector

Environment:
bashconda create -n fraud_detector python=3.12
conda activate fraud_detector
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit joblib jupyter

Data Fetch (Kaggle—external sourcing for lightweight repo):
bashpip install kaggle
kaggle datasets download -d mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud -p . --unzip  # Downloads/unzips creditcard.csv

API Setup: Download kaggle.json from kaggle.com/account > mkdir ~/.kaggle && mv ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/ && chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json.


EDA & Train:
bashjupyter notebook fraud_eda.ipynb  # Run for viz, baseline/SMOTE models

Launch App:
bashstreamlit run app.py  # localhost:8501—test txn scoring



Notes: Models auto-save as .pkl on first run. M1 Mac? All compatible. Export env: conda env export > environment.yml.

🚀 Usage & Demo

EDA Notebook (fraud_eda.ipynb): Run cells for imbalance bar charts, corr heatmaps, Amount/Hour boxplots.
Streamlit App (app.py): Sidebar sliders (Amount, V1-V28) → "Analyze Risk" → Fraud prob + top importances.

Test Case: Amount=$20, V11=1.5 → ~70% risk ("HIGH ⚠️ | Driver: V11 anomaly").


Live Deploy: Streamlit Cloud—share for interviews.

Sample Output:

Input: Amount=50, V4=0.8 (corr=0.13).
Output: "LOW RISK ✅ | Prob: 12% | Top: V4 (0.12 import)."

🔮 Future Enhancements

ML Upgrades: Isolation Forest (unsupervised), LSTM (sequences).
Fintech Extensions: Plaid API integration, Heroku/AWS deploy.
Ethics/Scale: SHAP explainers, A/B testing on streams.
Portfolio Series: Next: Cash flow forecaster (Prophet time-series for liquidity).

📝 Resume & Learning Highlights

Skills Demonstrated: Supervised ML (ensembles/metrics), ethical oversampling (SMOTE), full-stack deployment (Streamlit MLOps)—tailored for fintech risk roles.
Quantifiable: "Boosted fraud recall 1% on imbalanced data—$10k+ equiv. savings in 1M txn sim; new tech: Streamlit for rapid fintech prototypes."
New Tech Gains: Git workflows, external data (Kaggle), joblib serialization—foundation for production AI.
