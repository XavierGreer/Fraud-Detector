# Fraud Detection Prototype

## Overview
An in-progress TypeScript-based tool for detecting fraudulent transactions, reflecting my Schwab work improving anomaly detection by 90% for $300K in savings. This prototype uses a React frontend with AWS SageMaker for machine learning and SQL for data storage, aiming for 90% accuracy on 10K+ mock transactions.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TanStack Query
- **ML/Backend**: AWS SageMaker, SQL
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Version Control**: Git

## Status
- **Current Phase**: Development (Started Oct 2025)
- **Progress**: Mock data generation and model planning in progress.
- **Next Steps**: Train model, deploy to SageMaker, integrate with SQL.

## Roadmap
- **Week 4 (Oct 20-26, 2025)**: Generate data, train model, deploy to AWS.
- **Future**: Enhance with real-time API, document 90% accuracy achievement.
